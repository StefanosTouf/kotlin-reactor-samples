This repository contains self contained project samples showing how kotlin (written in a functional style) can be used along with project reactor to take advantage of existing java infrastructure in various scenarios. After experimenting with these projects, it seems like reactor can be used as a backbone for making various different services in kotlin, due to it being very wide spread, well supported and already intergrated in various libraries (e.g. the kotysa database client, the various reactive spring dependencies)

The samples are:
* `reactor-rabbitmq`, containing a small service showing how one can use reactor-rabbit with kotlin to consume from and publish to rabbitmq queues

* `spring-reactor-api` containing a small api connected to a database using spring libraries (spring-r2dbc, spring-webflux). The spring dependencies are used outside the springboot runtime and thus there isnt an ioc container for dependency injection. Using reactor as a backbone, one can effectively and easily use the reactive spring dependencies on their own. This takes out a lot of the spring "magic", making the codebase more functional and, from my observations, more appropriate for smaller services.
